## Context 

We want to use simple linear regression when modelling the relationship between pairs of data. They are usually noted as: 

$(x_1, y_1),(x_2, y_2), . . . ,(x_n, y_n)$

## Definition

The linear regression of a random variable Y on a random
variable X is defined as: 

$E(Y|X)= \beta_0 + \beta_1x$

$\beta_0, \beta_1$: parameters that determine intercept and slope of the specific regression line

* Y-variable: response variable
